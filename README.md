# Workshop: Python Basics

_[UC Davis DataLab](https://datalab.ucdavis.edu/)_  
_Fall 2021_  
_Instructors: Arthur Koehl <<avkoehl@ucdavis.edu>>,
  Nick Ulle <<naulle@ucdavis.edu>>_  

This 4-part workshop series provides an introduction to using the Python
programming language for reproducible data analysis and scientific computing.
Topics include programming basics, how to work with tabular data, how to break
down programming problems, and how to organize code for clarity and
reproducibility.

After this workshop, learners will be able to load tabular data sets into
Python, compute simple summaries and visualizations, do common data-tidying
tasks, write reusable functions, and identify where to go to learn more.

TODO: Requirements
<!--
No prior programming experience is necessary. All learners will need access to
an internet-connected computer and the latest version of Zoom, R, and RStudio.
