# Overview

This 4-part workshop series provides an introduction to using the Python
programming language for reproducible data analysis and scientific computing.
The focus of this workshop is programming basics and working with tabular data.
Along the way, we'll learn a little bit about how to break down programming
problems and organize for clarity and reproducibility.

After this workshop, learners will be able to load tabular data sets into
Python, compute simple summaries and visualizations, do common data-tidying
tasks, write reusable functions, and identify where to go to learn more.
