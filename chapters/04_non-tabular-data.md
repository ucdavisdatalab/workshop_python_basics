## Downloading Data Using Requests Module

Python is a very flexible programming language that supports many different 
tasks.

Often times, there exists a popular package that provides functions and 
datastructures to make writing code for that task easier. Using these packages
provides lots of benefits, including but not limited to, better tested code
(less bugs), efficient solutions (faster), interconnected to other common
packages, as well as providing a shared set of solutions (easier to find 
questions, documentation, and generally get help).

We have seen this concept so far this series with the `pandas` package - providing
support for tabular data analysis, as well as the `plotnine` package - providing
convenient plotting functions.

Two modules that we will use in this session are the `requests` module and the 
`json` module.

### The Requests Module

The `requests` module provides functions for working with HTTP from python.


## Dictionaries

## Loops
